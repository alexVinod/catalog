        "description": "React ist ein JavaScript-Framework zur Entwicklung von Benutzeroberflächen sowohl im Browser als auch auf Mobilgeräten. Entwickelt und eingesetzt von Facebook ist es mittlerweile als Open-Source-Projekt verfügbar und hat sich bereits im Einsatz bei diversen namhaften Websites, wie z. B. Airbnb und Netflix, bewährt. Dieses Buch stellt Ihnen die Konzepte von React, React Router und Redux anhand eines durchgehenden Beispiels vor. Sie lernen, wie Sie mit React wiederverwendbare UI-Komponenten entwickeln und wie Sie auf Basis der einzelnen Komponenten ganze Anwendungen zusammenbauen. Unter anderem werden folgende Themen behandelt: - Entwickeln und Testen eigener React-Komponenten auf Basis des JavaScript-Standards ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) - Routing mit dem React Router - Das Architektur-Modell Flux und wie damit komplette Anwendungen umgesetzt werden (am Beispiel des Redux-Frameworks) - Serverseitiges Rendern von React-Komponenten und -Anwendungen - Anbindung eines REST-Backends Die im Buch eingesetzten Sprachfeatures aus ES6 werden in einem eigenen Kapitel vorgestellt, sodass zum Verständnis des Buches Kenntnisse von ES5 ausreichen. Nach der Lektüre des Buches werden Sie in der Lage sein, eigene Projekte mit React umzusetzen.",

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.",

As easy as it may sound, making palgova requires a lot of patience.Milk is boiled and continuously stirred in a heavy bottom pan/kadai till the fats separate . While the traditional way of making this sweet may intimidate you, today I am sharing an easy and quick version of making this incredibly delicious sweet.
